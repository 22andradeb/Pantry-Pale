Pantry Pal: Your Unique Grocery Hub


**Project Description**
As universtiy students who have found ourselves living alone for the first time, we quickly realized the importance and diffciulty in carrying out effective grocery shopping. Essentially, we want to save moeny and time on this activity which we carry out on a nearly daily basis. Motivated by these factors, we developed the fundamentals of an easy-to-use platform that can serve as a hub for this essential aspect of our lives and aid us by facilitating carrying out of this task while at the same time helping us reducing our food waste to become more sustainable and healthier people.
