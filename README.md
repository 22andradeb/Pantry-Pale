**Project Title**

Pantry Pal: Your Unique Grocery Hub


**Project Description**

As universtiy students who have found ourselves living alone for the first time, we quickly realized the importance and diffciulty in carrying out effective grocery shopping. Essentially, we want to save moeny and time on this activity which we carry out on a nearly daily basis. Motivated by these factors, we developed the fundamentals of an easy-to-use platform that can serve as a hub for this essential aspect of our lives and aid us by facilitating carrying out of this task while at the same time helping us reducing our food waste to become more sustainable and healthier people.  
As users enter the app, the system will display the following areas, waiting for the user to choose where they want to be directed:
My fridge, 
Receipt Reader and
Groceries.
Here, they will be able to manage their groceries and waste management through multiple functionalities.
In the My fridge area, users will be to view each item they currently have in their fridge in order of expiration date from most to least perishable item. What allows the app the content of the products present in their fridges is the Receipt Reader feature of the app. This feature allows users to input a picture of their grocery receipt so that each item the My fridge area is updated with the new purchases, which are also saved into the Groceries area of the app as users can see their past grcoery purchases when making new grocery lists.
As if this wasn't enough, PantryPal will also send users notifications reminding them when one of the items present in their fridge are about to expire. This way, students will be able to proberly improve their Waste Management and lead more sustainable lives. 
In the development of this project, we faced multiple challenges. From the coding to the workload management, we oftentimes found ourselves struggling with our tasks; yet, through commitment and hard work we maanged to overcome these and output our best possible work with our current skill levels. We are especially proud of the Artificial Intelligence implementation within the Receipt Reader area of the platfrom which we believe makes us stand out from other projects. In order to stand out to an even greater extent, we had come up with a variety of ideas and features which we concluded to be unfeasible for our current skill-level. One feature that we had believed could add enormous value to the app was a mapping platform that essentially provided the optimal route to do one's groceries within supermarkets, based on the users' shopping lists. This could be conceptualized as a Google Maps for supermarkets, inputting shopping lists and outputting the locations of these items as well as the most time-efficient route for users from when they entered the store to when they exited it. Even though this functionality would have perfectly linked with our apps' core functions, we deemed it as unfeasible since it would have required making agreements with supermarkets to have their workers constantly update the position of items within their stores. Also, what might have seemed as a logical extension of our app was a delivery service that brought users the products within their grocery lists. However, we believed this to be too much of a liability for the initial stage of our app, and decided not to pursue it.
Even though we ended up not pursuing these features, we are still proud of our output and are grateful for what we learned in regard to how apps are actually developed in a professional work-environment. 

**How to Install and Run the Project**
